# mailchimp-random-coupons
A custom wordpress plugin to create random coupon code based on subsribers to mailchimp

Hi all energetic #wordpress developers!

I have recently created a small WordPress plugin to enable automatic coupon generation for users subscribing on MailChimp. This coupon is saved in merge field "COUPON" of the user profile.

I have created a public repository for this plugin on #github. The link is https://github.com/samiullahjamil99/mailchimp-random-coupons. The plugin is MVP and working but there are a lot of things to do in this such as error handling, more features.

I would love to have contributors for the plugin. Keep in mind that, this plugin is #opensource.

Thank you.
