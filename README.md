# mailchimp-random-coupons
A custom wordpress plugin to create random coupon code based on subsribers to mailchimp

Hi all energetic #wordpress developers!

I have recently created a small WordPress plugin to enable automatic coupon generation for users subscribing on MailChimp. This coupon is saved in merge field "COUPON" of the user profile.

I have created a public repository for this plugin on #github. The link is https://github.com/samiullahjamil99/mailchimp-random-coupons. The plugin is MVP and working but there are a lot of things to do in this such as error handling, more features.

I would love to have contributors for the plugin. Keep in mind that, this plugin is #opensource.

Before developing you need to make sure to install the composer dependencies as they are not the part of the repository and needed to be installed separately. In order to do that use "composer install" in main plugin directory on terminal to install the dependencies.

Thank you.
